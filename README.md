Sample app for demonstrating use of submodules in Node.js package development

This repository exists solely to demonstrate using Git submodules to support developing a Node.js package.

It is configured to load [robogeek/sample-package-2021-12-1](https://github.com/robogeek/sample-package-2021-12-12) as a submodule.  The purpose is demonstrating how this makes it easy to edit and develop a Node.js package in the context of a sample application.

This package was implemented for the purpose of [Using Git submodules to streamline Node.js package development](https://techsparx.com/nodejs/tools/submodules.html)
